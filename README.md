LaTeXpackages
=============

During my time in summer math, I created a LaTeX package to expidite some of the commonly repeated
constructs used in linear algebra, such as bracketed matricies, augmented matricies, and iterative lists.

I also made avalible stylized derivatives in Lebiniz notation, as well as quicker partial derivatives (since
I was taking a multivariable class concurrently with Linear Algebra).

In addition to the .sty file, I have included a .tex file which shows examples of the various constructs and
and how to use the file in a standard LaTeX file.
